The set up of the panelist-detection-device requires only a few simple steps:

-   First you have to connect the device to the electrical outlet.
-   Then that you use the other cable to connect the device to the TV.

If you did these two steps correctly, a green light should appear on the device if you start the TV. This means the device is turned on and is already diligently detecting panelists.

**IMPORTANT**: Adjust the device in a way that the built-in-camera is facing in the same direction as the TV and nothing is blocking its view!

You don't have to set the system manually, the camera detects all faces in front of the TV and registers every new and unrecognized face. The device continues to detect panelists until the TV is turned off. If thatâ€™s the case, the green light as well as the camera turns off.
