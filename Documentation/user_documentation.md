# User Documentation

After uploading the software to, e.g., a Raspberry Pi and placing its camera next to the desired TV area, the program starts capturing real-time images from the panelists' living area according to specified intervals. With the help of a graphical user interface the user can see the extracted faces from each frame. For each detected face, a new entry is created with the detected ID of the user as well as their predicted age, gender, emotion, and attention.

When clicking on an entry, an actual photo of the corresponding panelist's face is displayed. Here, it is also possible to enter a new name for the user and update their information: age and gender. In the next iterations, when the same user is recognized, their entered name and correct age and gender are displayed.
